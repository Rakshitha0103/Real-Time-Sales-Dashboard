# Sales Analytics Dashboard (Looker Studio)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Sales Analytics Dashboard** developed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship** using **Looker Studio**.  
The dashboard analyzes transactional sales data to evaluate **order behavior, pricing impact, discount effectiveness, profitability, sales growth, and inventory pressure** across multiple product categories.

The objective is to transform raw sales data into **clear, business-actionable insights** for sales, marketing, and operations teams.

- Analysis of **net profit vs discount percentage**  
- Validation of whether higher discounts increase **sales quantity**  
- Tracking **monthly sales growth** alongside **average discount rates**  
- Evaluation of **inventory pressure** across product categories
